# TkVideoplayer

This is a simple library to play video files in tkinter. This library also provides the ability to play, pause, 
skip and seek to specific timestamps.

#### Example:
```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkVideoPlayer import TkinterVideo

root = tk.Tk()

videoplayer = TkinterVideo(master=root, scaled=True)
videoplayer.load(r"samplevideo.mp4")
videoplayer.pack(expand=True, fill="both")

videoplayer.play() # play the video

root.mainloop()
```

read the documentation [here](https://browsedocs.com/bWXP7P4Tpxhz)

you can easily integrate this with **CustomTkinter** as well: refer [How to integrate with CustomTkinter?](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/tkVideoPlayer/discussions/23#discussioncomment-4475005)

> Please immediately upgrade to the latest version if you are using version 1.3 or below
